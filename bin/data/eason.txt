For close to three decades, Hong Kong music sensation Eason Chan has been electrifying audiences. And he showed no signs of lethargy as he fielded questions from reporters on Monday (Apr 17), fresh off two successful weekend shows at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

The 48-year-old Cantopop star's recent Fear And Dreams tour marked the first time he was back performing in Singapore since 2017, and CNA Lifestyle caught up with Chan to talk about his lasting career and the future of the Cantopop scene.
